## Introduction

Welcome to DA 6223. This course is designed to be pragmatic and give you the real world tools you will need to secure a job or further your academic career. With that in mind, this document is designed to give you a head start into the course materials and solidify your foundation in coding in R and Python. I am providing videos and reading materials below that are all accessible online. Please take advantage of these as they will assist your understanding of R and Python basics and allow us to more quickly get to the meat of the course and provide you with a robust understanding of practical R and Python coding skills.

We will also refer to some of this material throughout the course so do not feel like you have to go through it all now. This is especially true for the cheat sheets. I look forward to teaching you all this semester! Relax, and breath, we will get through this together and if you give maximum effort in this course your grade will reflect it.
